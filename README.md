# 🛳️ Titanic Data Analysis and Visualization Project

This project dives into the famous Titanic dataset to explore patterns in passenger survival using professional data cleaning, feature engineering, and in-depth visual analytics. It is designed as a high-level portfolio project suitable for showcasing data analysis skills on a resume.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Perform detailed **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset
- Clean and prepare data with proper handling of missing values and types
- Engineer new features (e.g., Title, Family Size) to uncover deeper insights
- Create high-impact **visualizations** to communicate survival trends
- Derive actionable business or analytical **insights** from data storytelling

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **GitHub** for version control and publishing

---

## 📊 Key Visual Insights

- 🔍 Women and children had significantly higher survival rates than men
- 🏷️ Social titles like "Mr", "Miss", and "Master" revealed social class and survival advantage
- 💼 1st Class passengers had higher survival rates than 2nd and 3rd class
- 👨‍👩‍👧 Larger families had a lower chance of survival compared to solo travelers
- 💰 Fare paid also correlated with likelihood of survival
